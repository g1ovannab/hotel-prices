# java price dynamic
Coding project for an internship. 

For this project, we have 3 hotels with 4 different prices. One is for the VIP clients on weekdays, VIP clients on weekend days, regular clients on weekdays and regular clients on weekend days.

The user says which type of client he is and the dates he want to stay in a hotel.

The program will calculate the best cost benefit and return the best hotel to stay (prioritizing the lowest price and after, the highest star ranking).
